# Analysing refugee statistics

Analysis of forced displacement trends using data from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). This work was part of an assignment for a posgraduate course on data analysis. Completed in November 2021.

The data analysis was done in a Jupyter Notebook and it was used to write up a 5-page report.


## Purpose of the analysis and report

The purpose of the assignment was to present findings in a clear and persuasive way to a non-academic audience, to communicate the wider context of findings and to demonstrate critical thinking about the data and results. 

My analysis examines data from the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). UNHCR collects data on people officially classed as refugees and tracks asylum claims, while also collating data from other organisations. The analysis explored:
- what are some of the largest population displacement events in the last 20 years?
- which countries have been the largest hosts of asylum seekers in the last 20 years?
- what has been the impact of Covid-19 in people displaced and asylum applications?

In my report the target audience is an international organization working closely with UNHCR in providing support to refugees worldwide. The organisation is interested in a short report informing on the key displacement events and key host countries in the last 20 years. It is assumed that the audience is familiar with UNHCR categories of displaced groups (refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people, stateless persons, Venezuelans displaced abroad, others of concern).
